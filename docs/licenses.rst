.. rubric:: notes

.. [#]
   - Big Script: file size exceeds a certain value.
   - Mix Str: obfuscating string constant in script
.. [#]
   - RFT Mode: renaming function/class/method/variable in Python scripts
   - BCC Mode: Transforming some Python functions in scripts to c functions, compile them to machine instructions directly
.. [#] Offline build: the build device need not be online to verify Pyarmor License
.. [#] Maximum devices could install Pyarmor
.. [#] Unlimited local dockers: run docker container in local machine, may be offline or in private network
.. [#] Work in CI/CD pipeline: it need special option to register Pyarmor in CI/CD pipeline

.. important::

    All Pyarmor Licenses are only used to generate the obfuscated scripts in build device

    It need neither install Pyarmor nor verify Pyarmor License to execute obfuscated scripts

    The obfuscated scripts are generated by Pyarmor, but they are completely independent of Pyarmor

    You can take them as normal Python scripts, so what the obfuscated scripts do is controlled by you, not by Pyarmor

Terms of Use
============

1. Only use Pyarmor on your own scripts

   In any case, even you have purchased Pyarmor License, it's not allowed to obfuscate other scripts of which you haven't property. For example, call pyarmor in your app to obfuscate your customer's scripts, provide obfuscation services based on Pyarmor by website etc.

2. No profit no license required

   Free version can be used to obfuscate your scripts which COULD NOT make lot of money for you. Otherwise it need purchase Pyarmor License.

3. One product one license

   One product means one kind of product, not one copy of product. For example, Micorsoft Excel is one product, even it's installed on coutless devices

   Each license has an unique number, the format is ``pyarmor-vax-xxxxxx``, which x stands for a digital.

4. Pay once

   The purchased license works forever with Pyarmor version when this license is purchased, but may not work in future Pyarmor version

5. Fair use

   If you have purchased Pyarmor License for one product, but you have aother product, and the total revenue of the other project is less than 100 x Pyarmor License fee, you could rent this license in your aother product

.. seealso:: `Pyarmor EULA`_, :doc:`Using Pyarmor Licenses <how-to/register>`

Privacy
=======

License No. and product name will be embedded into obfuscated scripts, all the other user's information, for example, regname, email are not

For Pyarmor Basic and Pro License, only Pyarmor License file, serial number of hard disk, Ethernet address, IPv4/IPv6 address, and hostname will be sent to remote server for verification. No any user script will be uploaded to remote server

What Is One Product
-------------------

First of all, if not for sale, all the Python scripts are belong to one product "non-profits".

One product in Pyarmor world means a product name and everything that makes up this name.

It includes all the devices to develop, build, debug, test product.

It also includes product current version, history versions and all the future versions.

One product may has several variants, each variant name is composed of product name plus feature name. As long as the proportion of the variable part is far less than that of the common part, they're considered as "one product".

Pyarmor is one product, it includes:

* Pyarmor basic, Pyarmor pro, and Pyarmor group
* pyarmor-webui which provides graphics interface for pyarmor.
* the order system of Pyarmor is a Django's app running in cloud-server. This Django's app also belongs to one product Pyarmor.
* the laptop used to develop Pyarmor, the PCs used to test Pyarmor, the cloud-server to serve order system of Pyarmor, all of them belong to one product Pyarmor.
* Pyarmor 7.x, Pyarmor 8.x and Pyarmor 9.x

Microsoft Office is not one product, because each product in Microsoft Office is functional independence. For example, Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel belong to Microsoft Office, but they're totally different.

Microsoft Word is one product, and Microsoft Word 2003ï¼ŒWord 2007 etc. are belong to one product Microsoft word.
