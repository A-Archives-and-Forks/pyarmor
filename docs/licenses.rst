Introduction
============

This documentation is only apply to Pyarmor_ 8.0 plus.

Pyarmor is published as shareware, free trial version never expires, but there are some limitations:

a. Can not obfuscate big scritps [1]_
b. Can not use feature mix-str [2]_ to obfuscate string constant in scripts
c. Can not use RFT Mode [3]_, BCC Mode [4]_
d. Can not be used for any commercial product without permission
e. Can not be used to provide obfuscation service in any form

These limitations can be unlocked by different License Types except last one.

License types
=============

Pyarmor has 3 kind of licenses:

.. glossary::

    Pyarmor Basic

        Basic license could unlock big script [1]_ and mix-str [2]_ feature.

        It requires internet connection to verify license when obfuscating the scripts.

    Pyarmor Pro

        Pro license could unlock big script [1]_ and mix-str [2]_ feature.

        Pro license also unlocks BCC Mode [4]_ and RFT Mode [3]_

        It requires internet connection to verify license when obfuscating the scripts.

    Pyarmor Group

        Group license unlocks all limitions.

        Group license need not internet connection when obfuscating the scripts.

Refer to :doc:`use Pyarmor License <how-to/register>`

For the obfuscated scripts run in the customer's device, Pyarmor has no any limitions, it's totally controlled by users. Pyarmor only cares about build machine.

Each license has an unique number, the format is ``pyarmor-vax-xxxxxx``, which x stands for a digital.

Each product requires one License No. So any product in global also has an unique number in Pyarmor world.

If user has many products, many license are required.

One product in Pyarmor world means a product name and everything that makes up this name.

It includes all the devices to develop, build, debug, test product.

It also includes product current version, history versions and all the future versions.

One product may has several variants, each variant name is composed of product name plus feature name. As long as the proportion of the variable part is far less than that of the common part, they're considered as "one product".

Pyarmor License could be installed in many machines and devices which belong to licensed product. But there is limitation to be used at the same time.

In 24 hours only less than 100 devices can use one same Pyarmor License. Pyarmor License be used means use any feature of Pyarmor in one machine. Running obfuscated scripts generated by Pyarmor is not considered as Pyarmor License be used.

In details read `EULA of Pyarmor`_

**What's one product**

First of all, if not for sale, all the Python scripts are belong to one product.

Pyarmor is one product, it includes:

* Pyarmor basic, Pyarmor pro, and Pyarmor group
* pyarmor-webui which provides graphics interface for pyarmor.
* the order system of Pyarmor is a django app running in cloud-server. This django app also belongs to one product Pyarmor.
* the laptop used to develop Pyarmor, the PCs used to test Pyarmor, the cloud-server to serve order system of Pyarmor, all of them belong to one product Pyarmor.
* Pyarmor 7.x, Pyarmor 8.x and Pyarmor 9.x

Microsoft Office is not one product, because each product in Microsoft Office is functional independence. For example, Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel belong to Microsoft Office, but they're totally different.

Microsoft Word is one product, and Micorsoft Word 2003ï¼ŒWord 2007 etc. are belong to one product Microsoft word.

Upgrading old license to Pyarmor Basic
--------------------------------------

First find the activation file ``pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt``, which is sent to registration email when purchasing the license.

Next install Pyarmor 8.2+, according to new `EULA of Pyarmor`_, each license is only for one product.

Assume this license will be used to obfuscate product ``XXX``, run this command::

    $ pyarmor reg -u -p "XXX" pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt

Check the upgraded license information::

    $ pyarmor -v

After upgrade successfully, do not use activation file ``pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt`` again, it's invalid now. A new :term:`registration file` like :file:`pyarmor-regfile-xxxx.zip` will be generated at the same time.

In other devices using this new :term:`registration file` to register Pyarmor by this command::

    $ pyarmor reg pyarmor-regfile-xxxx.zip

After successful registration, all obfuscations will automatically apply this license, and each obfuscation requires online license verification.

If old license is used by many products (mainly old personal license), only one product could be used after upgrading. For the others, it need purchase new license.

Upgrading old license to Pyarmor Pro
------------------------------------

Open shopping cart in any web browser:

    https://order.mycommerce.com/product?vendorid=200089125&productid=301044051

If you have Pyarmor 8.2+ installed, this command also could open shopping cart::

    $ pyarmor reg --buy

    $ pyarmor reg -u -p "XXX" pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt
