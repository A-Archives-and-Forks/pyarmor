Introduction
============

This documentation is only apply to Pyarmor_ 8.0 plus.

Pyarmor is published as shareware, free trial version never expires, but there
are some limitations:

a. Can not obfuscate big scritps [1]_
b. Can not use feature mix-str [2]_ to obfuscate string constant in scripts
c. Can not use RFT Mode [3]_, BCC Mode [4]_
d. Can not be used for any commercial product without permission
e. Can not be used to provide obfuscation service in any form

These limitations can be unlocked by different `License Types`_ except last one.

License types
=============

Pyarmor has 3 kind of licenses:

.. glossary::

    Pyarmor Basic

        Basic license could unlock big script [1]_ and mix-str [2]_ feature.

        It requires internet connection to verify license

    Pyarmor Pro

        Pro license could unlock big script [1]_ and mix-str [2]_ feature.

        Pro license also unlocks BCC Mode [4]_ and RFT Mode [3]_

        It requires internet connection to verify license

    Pyarmor Group

        Group license unlocks all limitions and doesn't require internet.

Internet connection is only used to verify Pyarmor License in the build machine
to generate the obfuscated scripts.

For the obfuscated scripts run in the customer's device, Pyarmor has no any
limitions, it's totally controlled by users. Pyarmor only cares about build
machine.

Each license has an unique number, the format is ``pyarmor-vax-xxxxxx``, which x
stands for a digital.

Each product requires one License No. So any product in global also has an
unique number in Pyarmor world.

If user has many products, many license are required.

One product in Pyarmor world means a product name and everything that makes up
this name.

It includes all the devices to develop, build, debug, test product.

It also includes product current version, history versions and all the future
versions.

One product may has several variants, each variant name is composed of product
name plus feature name. As long as the proportion of the variable part is far
less than that of the common part, they're considered as "one product".

Pyarmor License could be installed in many machines and devices which belong to
licensed product. But there is limitation to be used at the same time.

In 24 hours only less than 100 devices can use one same Pyarmor License. Pyarmor
License be used means use any feature of Pyarmor in one machine. Running
obfuscated scripts generated by Pyarmor is not considered as Pyarmor License be
used.

In details read `EULA of Pyarmor`_

Following the guide in activation file to take the purchased license effects.

There are no additional license fees, apart from the cost of the license. And it
only needs to be paid once, not periodically

Refund policy
-------------

If activation file isn't used, and purchasing date is in six months, refund is
accepted. Please send request to |Contact|, Pyarmor will refund the order in a
week. Out of six monthes, or activation file has been used to activate the
license, refund request is not accepted.

Why no refund even if my PayPal account is hacked and someone else bought
Pyarmor by this PayPal account?

Imaging you lost cash â‚¬100, someone else got it and buys a cloth, I don't think
the shopper should refund money to you. It's same for money in PayPal, you lost
money by yourself, the shopper should not bear loss because of your fault.

.. _upgrading old license:

Upgrading old license
=====================

Not all the old license could be upgraded to latest version.

The old license could be upgraded to Pyarmor Basic freely only if it matchs
these conditions:

* Following new `EULA of Pyarmor`_
* The license no. starts with ``pyarmor-vax-``
* The original activation file ``pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt`` is used not more
  than 100 times.

If it's not matched, please purchase new license to use Pyarmor latest version.

Upgrading to Pyarmor Pro needs extra fees.

Freely to Pyarmor-Basic
-----------------------

First find the activation file ``pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt``, which is sent
to registration email when purchasing the license.

In any build machine which has old license, first install Pyarmor 8.0+.

Be careful to keep old license file still in the Pyarmor :term:`Home Path`,
generally it's :file:`~/.pyarmor`.

If product name is set when purchasing old license, run this command::

    $ pyarmor reg -u pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt

If no product name is set when purchasing old license, please decide which
product will use this upgraded license. According to new `EULA of Pyarmor`_,
each license is only for one product.

If this license is only for internal use or non-profits use, run this command as
above, in this case product name will be set to ``non-profits``::

    $ pyarmor reg -u pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt

For commercial use, assume product ``Robot Studio`` will use this license, run
this command::

    $ pyarmor reg -u -p "Robot Studio" pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt

Check the upgraded license information::

    $ pyarmor -v

If old license is used by many products (mainly old personal license), only one
product could be used after upgrading. For the others, it need purchase new
license.
