# Pyarmor 9 Change Logs

Because Pyarmor License is paid once in Pyarmor 8, but online verification for using Pyarmor License in CI/CD pipeline will continue consuming a lot of Pyarmor Server resources.

So Pyarmor 9 has a big change about using Pyarmor in CI/CD pipeline:

- Pyarmor Pro License couldn't be used in CI/CD pipeline since Pyarmor 9
- Pyarmor CI License is right for CI/CD pipeline case
- Pyarmor Basic still could be used in CI/CD pipeline, but it need request one extra CI regfile

In a short

**If not use Pyarmor License in CI/CD pipeline, almost nothing changed**
**If not upgrade to Pyarmor 9, but still use Pyarmor 8, nothing changed**
**Pyarmor Pro License purchased after Pyarmor 9 is released could not be used in CI/CD pipeline even use it with Pyarmor 8**

Pyarmor CI License is paid each year, and couldn't be used in local machine.

         $ pyarmor reg pyarmor-regfile-xxxx.zip

It need generate device regfile again with Pyarmor 9.0+

- First upgrade to Pyarmor 9

  For example, generate device regfile `pyarmor-device-regfile-6000.1.zip` for device no. 1
  ```bash
      $ pyarmor reg -g 1 /path/to/pyarmor-regfile-6000.zip
   ```
