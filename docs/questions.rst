- **If we buy version 8 license, is it compatible with earlier versions like 6.7.2?**
  No. Pyarmor 8 license can't be used with earlier versions, it may report HTTP 401 error or some unknown errors.

- **Our company has a suite of products that we offer together or separately to our clients. Do we need a different license for each of them?**

  For a suite of products, if each product is different totally, for example, a suite "Microsoft Office” includes “Microsoft Excel”, “Microsoft Word”, each product need one license.

  If a suite of products share most of Python scripts, as long as the proportion of the variable part of each product is far less than that of the common part, they’re considered as "one product".

  If each product in a suite of products is functionally complementary, for example, product “Editor” for editing the file, product “Viewer” for view the file, they’re considered as “one product"

- **I want to test obfs with version 8. Of course i want to buy your great product but i want to test if it is applicable with my current project. Is it possible to have 7 days demo?**

  Sorry, Pyarmor is a small tool and only cost small money, there is no demo license plan.

  Most of features could be verified in trial version, other advanced features, for example, mix-str, bcc mode and rft mode, could be configured to ignore one function or one script so that all the others could work with these advanced features.
