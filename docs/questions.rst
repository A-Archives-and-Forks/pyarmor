Asking Questions In Github
==========================

Before ask question, please also do a simple test, obfuscate a hello world script, and run it with python, check the obfuscated scripts or not.

License
=======

- **We are currently using a trial license for testing, but unfortunately our scripts are big and we are not able to statistically test the operation of Pyarmor. Do you have a commercial trial license for a certain trial period so that we can test the operation of Pyarmor for our scripts?**

  Sorry, Pyarmor is a small tool and only cost small money, there is no demo license plan.

  Most of features could be verified in trial version, other advanced features, for example, mix-str, bcc mode and rft mode, could be configured to ignore one function or one script so that all the others could work with these advanced features.

  **Is the Internet connection only required to generate the obfuscated script? No internet connection is required on the target device that uses such script?**

  No internet connection is required on target device, please check Pyarmor EULA 3.4.1

  > this software has no any control or limitation to obfuscated scripts, the behaviours of obfuscated scripts are totally defined by user.

- **I am interested to know if the users are entitled to updates to ensure compatibility with future versions of Python.**

  No. Pyarmor license works for ever with current Pyarmor version, but may not work with future Pyarmor version. I can't make sure current Pyarmor version could support all the future versions of Python, so the answer is no.

- **If we buy version 8 license, is it compatible with earlier versions like 6.7.2?**
  No. Pyarmor 8 license can't be used with earlier versions, it may report HTTP 401 error or some unknown errors.

- **Our company has a suite of products that we offer together or separately to our clients. Do we need a different license for each of them?**

  For a suite of products, if each product is different totally, for example, a suite "Microsoft Office” includes “Microsoft Excel”, “Microsoft Word”, each product need one license.

  If a suite of products share most of Python scripts, as long as the proportion of the variable part of each product is far less than that of the common part, they’re considered as "one product".

  If each product in a suite of products is functionally complementary, for example, product “Editor” for editing the file, product “Viewer” for view the file, they’re considered as “one product"
