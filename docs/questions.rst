* Our company has a suite of products that we offer together or separately to
  our clients. Do we need a different license for each of them?

  Answer::

      For a suite of products, if each product is different totally, for example,
      a suite "Microsoft Office” includes “Microsoft Excel”, “Microsoft Word”,
      each product need one license.

      If a suite of products share most of Python scripts, as long as the
      proportion of the variable part of each product is far less than that of the
      common part, they’re considered as "one product".

      If each product in a suite of products is functionally complementary, for
      example, product “Editor” for editing the file, product “Viewer” for
      view the file, they’re considered as “one product"

* I want to test obfs with version 8. Of course i want to buy your great product
  but i want to test if it is applicable with my current project. Is it possible
  to have 7 days demo?

  Answer::

      Sorry, Pyarmor is a small tool and only cost small money, there is no demo
      license plan.

      Most of features could be verified in trial version, other advanced
      features, for example, mix-str, bcc mode and rft mode, could be configured
      to ignore one function or one script so that all the others could work with
      these advanced features.
