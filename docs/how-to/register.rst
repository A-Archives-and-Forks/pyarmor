Prerequisite
============

First of all

1. An :term:`activation file` of :term:`Pyarmor License` like :file:`pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt`, refer to :doc:`../licenses` to purchase right one
2. Pyarmor 8.2+
3. Internet connection
4. Product name bind to this license, for non-commercial use, product name is ``non-profits``

**If any firewall turns on**

In Windows ``pytransform.pyd`` will connect to ``pyarmor.dashingsoft.com`` port ``80`` to request token for online obfuscation, in other platforms it is ``pytransform3.so``. Refer to firewall documentation to allow it to connect ``pyarmor.dashingsoft.com:80``.

Using Pyarmor Basic or Pro
==========================

Basic use steps:

1. Using :term:`activation file` to initial registration, set product name bind to this license
2. Once initial registration completed, a :term:`registration file` is generated
3. Using :term:`registration file` to register Pyarmor in other devices

Initial registration
--------------------

Using :option:`-p` to specify product name for this license, for non-commercial use, set product name to ``non-profits``.

Assume this license is used to protect your product ``XXX``, initial registration by this command::

    $ pyarmor reg -p "XXX" pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt

Pyarmor will show registration information and ask for your confirmation. If everything is fine, type :kbd:`yes` and :kbd:`Enter` to continue. Any other input aborts registration.

If initial registration is successful, it prints final license information in the console. And a :term:`registration file` like :file:`pyarmor-regfile-xxxx.zip` is generated in the current path at the same time. This file is used for subsequent registration in other machines.

Once initial registration completed, activation file :file:`pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt` is invalid, do not use it again.

Once initial registration completed, product name can't be changed.

Please backup registration file :file:`pyarmor-regfile-xxxx.zip` carefully. If lost, Pyarmor is not responsible for keeping this license and no lost-found service.

Product name is not decided
---------------------------

When a product is in development, and the product name is not decided. Set product name to ``TBD`` on initial registration. For example::

    $ pyarmor reg -p "TBD" pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt

In 6 months real product name must be set by this command::

    $ pyarmor reg -p "XXX" pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt

If it's not changed after 6 months, the product name will be set to ``non-profits`` automatically and can't be changed again.

Registering in other machines
-----------------------------

Copy :term:`registration file` :file:`pyarmor-regfile-xxxx.zip` to other machines, run the following command::

    $ pyarmor reg pyarmor-regfile-xxxx.zip

Check the registration information::

    $ pyarmor -v

After successful registration, all obfuscations will automatically apply this license, and each obfuscation requires online license verification.

Registering in Docker or CI pipeline
------------------------------------

It's no problem to run Pyarmor in Docker or CI pipeline to obfuscate user's application. Register pyarmor with :file:`pyarmor-regfile-xxxx.zip` same as above. **But It's not allowed to distribute pyarmor self and any Pyarmor License to customer**

Don't run too many build dockers, maximum is 100 in 24 hours. If more than 100 runs one day, please use Pyarmor Group License.

Using group license
===================

.. versionadded:: 8.2

Each :term:`Pyarmor Group` could have 100 offline devices, each device has its own number, from 1 to 100.

Basic use steps:

1. Using activation file :file:`pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt` to initial registration, set product name bind to this license, and generate :term:`registration file` [#]_
2. Generating group device file separately on each offline device
3. Using :term:`registration file` and group device file to generate device registration file.
4. Using device registration file to register Pyarmor on offline device [#]_

.. [#] Pyarmor will review group license manually and enable it in 24 hours since activation file is sent.
.. [#] The device registration file is bind to specified device, each device has its own device regfile

Initial registration
--------------------

After purchasing :term:`Pyarmor Group`, an activation file :file:`pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt` is sent to registration email.

Initial registration need internet connection and Pyarmor 8.2+. Suppose product name is ``XXX``, then run this command::

    $ pyarmor reg -p XXX pyarmor-regcode-xxxx.txt

After initial registration completed, a :term:`registration file` ``pyarmor-regfile-xxxx.zip`` will be generated.

Group device file
-----------------

On each offline device, install Pyarmor 8.2+, and generate group device file. For example, on device no. 1, run this command::

    $ pyarmor reg -g 1

It will generate group device file ``pyarmor-group-device.1``.

Generating offline device regfile
---------------------------------

Generating offline device regfile needs an internet connection, Pyarmor 8.2+, group device file  ``pyarmor-group-device.1`` and group license :term:`registration file` ``pyarmor-regfile-xxxx.zip``.

Copying group device file ``pyarmor-group-device.1`` to initial registration device or any computer which has internet connection and registration file, this file must be saved in the path ``.pyarmor/group/``, then run the following command to generate device regfile ``pyarmor-device-regfile-xxxx.1.zip``::

    $ mkdir -p .pyarmor/group
    $ cp pyarmor-group-device.1 .pyarmor/group/

    $ pyarmor reg -g 1 /path/to/pyarmor-regfile-xxxx.zip

Registering Pyarmor in offline device
-------------------------------------

Once device regfile is generated, copy it to the corresponding device, run this command to register Pyarmor::

    $ pyarmor reg pyarmor-device-regfile-xxxx.1.zip

Check registration information::

    $ pyarmor -v

After successful registration, all obfuscations will automatically apply this group license, and each obfuscation need not online license verification.

Run unlimited dockers in offline device
---------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 8.3

Group license supports unlimited dockers which uses default bridge network and not highly customized, the docker containers use same device regfile of host.

Each docker host is an offlice device.

The prerequisite in docker host:

- offline device regfile ``pyarmor-device-regfile-xxxx.1.zip`` as above
- Pyarmor 8.3.9+

The practice for group license with unlimited docker containers:

- Docker host, Ubuntu x86_64, Python 3.8
- Docker container, Ubuntu x86_64, Python 3.11

First copy the following files to docker host:

- pyarmor-8.3.9.tar.gz
- pyarmor.cli.core-4.3.5-cp38-none-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
- pyarmor.cli.core-4.3.5-cp311-none-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
- pyarmor-device-regfile-6000.1.zip

Then run the following commands in the docker host::

    $ python3 --version
    Python 3.8.10

    $ pip install pyarmor.cli.core-4.3.5-cp38-none-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
    $ pip install pyarmor-8.3.9.tar.bgz

Next start ``pyarmor-auth`` to listen the request from docker containers::

    $ pyarmor-auth pyarmor-device-regfile-6000.1.zip

    2023-06-24 09:43:14,939: work path: /root/.pyarmor/docker
    2023-06-24 09:43:14,940: register "pyarmor-device-regfile-6000.1.zip"
    2023-06-24 09:43:15,016: listen container auth request on 0.0.0.0:29092

Do not close this console, open another console to run dockers.

For Linux container run it with extra ``--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway`` (this option is not required for Windows and Darwin container)::

    $ docker run -it --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway python bash

    root@86b180b28a50:/# python --version
    Python 3.11.4
    root@86b180b28a50:/#

In docker host open third console to copy files to container::

    $ docker cp pyarmor-8.3.9.tar.gz 86b180b28a50:/
    $ docker cp pyarmor.cli.core-4.3.5-cp311-none-manylinux1_x86_64.whl 86b180b28a50:/
    $ docker cp pyarmor-device-regfile-6000.1.zip 86b180b28a50:/

In docker container, register Pyarmor with same device regfile. For example::

    root@86b180b28a50:/# pip install pyarmor.cli.core-4.3.5-cp311-none-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
    root@86b180b28a50:/# pip install pyarmor-8.3.9.tar.gz
    root@86b180b28a50:/# pyarmor reg pyarmor-device-regfile-6000.1.zip
    root@86b180b28a50:/# echo "print('hello world')" > foo.py
    root@86b180b28a50:/# pyarmor gen --enable-rft foo.py

When need to verify license, the docker container will send request to docker host.

Using group license in CI pipeline
----------------------------------

Pyarmor group license could not be used in CI pipeline with default runners, but it may work on something like `self-host runner`__, please check CI documentation for more information.

The other workaround is that first obfuscating scripts in docker container like above, then create a new branch to store obfuscated scripts in VC server.ã€‚

CI pipeline could get obfuscated scripts from this new branch, and start workflow as they're normal Python scripts.
