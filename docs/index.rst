How the documentation is organized
==================================

|Pyarmor| has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it's organized will help you know where to look for certain things:

* :doc:`Part 1: Tutorials <part-1>` takes you by the hand through a series of steps to obfuscate |Python| scripts and packages. Start here if you're new to |Pyarmor|. Also look at the :doc:`tutorial/getting-started`

* :doc:`Part 2: How To <part-2>` guides are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how |Python| works.

* :doc:`Part 3: References <part-3>` guides contain key concepts, man page, configurations and other aspects of |Pyarmor| machinery.

* :doc:`Part 4: Topics <part-4>` guides insight into key topics and provide useful background information and explanation. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.

* :doc:`Part 5: Licenses <licenses>` describes EULA of |Pyarmor|, the different |Pyarmor| licenses and how to purchase |Pyarmor| license.
