# Pyarmor 8.x Change Logs

In order to improve security and support Python 3.11, there are significant
changes in Pyarmor 8.0

## New features

* Support Python 3.11
* Introduce 3 new commands: gen, cfg, reg
* Introduce BCC Mode, an irreversible obfuscation method
* Introduce RFT mode, an irreversible obfuscation method
* Localize and internationalize runtime error messages
* Check expired date by NTP server

## Fix bugs for old modes

* Fix bug (#908): `--mix-str` of command `obfuscate` doesn't work if
  there is encoding line

## Import Notes for Pyarmor prior to 8.0

In future only bug fix for old commands, no new features for old commands.

The old commands `obfuscate`, `licenses` etc. still could be used, but there
have some changes.

There are 3 cases for old users after Pyarmor 8.0 is released:

1. Never upgrade to 8.0+

  - SPP mode doesn't work

    In order to use SPP mode, it's necessary to upgrade Pyarmor to 8.0+

  - Command `pyarmor register` without any argument return `404` error

    It is used to query registration information in old Pyarmor, but now license
    server doesn't serve this web api.

    Instead use `pyarmor -v` to make sure it's not trial version.

  - Registering Pyarmor by `pyarmor register pyarmor-regcode-xxxxxx.txt` can be
    used no more than 10 times

    In order to use Pyarmor in new machine, CI server or docker, check the second
    method described in the registration file "pyarmor-regcode-xxxxxx.txt":

        Downloading "pyarmor-regfile-xxxxxx.zip" once, use this `.zip` file to
        register Pyarmor later.

2. Upgrade to 8.0 but only use old features

  By default, command `pyarmor` only accepts new commands, there are 3 ways to
  use old commands such as `obfuscate`, `licenses`:

  - Use `pyarmor-7` instead `pyarmor`
  - Export environment variable `PYARMOR_CLI=7`, then still use `pyarmor`
  - Any way to call entry point `pyarmor.pyarmor:main_entry`

3. Upgrade to 8.0 and use new features

  - Follow new [EULA of Pyarmor](LICENSE). It's a big change for old personal
    license, because new license only allows one proudct.

  - Not all old licenses could be upgraded to new license freely, refer to
    [Pyarmor licenses][licenses]

  - The old commands need not internect connection, but new command need

  - The old commands support Python 2.7~3.10, but new command only support
    Python 3.7+
